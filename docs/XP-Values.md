### XP Values

In our Learning Management System project, our team particularly focused on embracing the core XP values of Feedback and Communication throughout the development process. Here's a breakdown of the procedures and strategies we implemented to ensure these values were upheld:

### 1. Communication

Weekly Scrum meets:
Our team held weekly scrum meetings, where each member shared updates on their tasks, planned next steps, and expressed any immediate blockers. This routine ensured that all members stayed aligned and could quickly adjust to any changes or new requirements.

Collaborative Tools:
We used collaborative tools like Slack for constant communication and Google Meet for our daily stand-ups and more extended weekly sessions. This helped maintain clear and open communication channels, ensuring everyone was aware of the project's progress and any issues.

Documentation:
All meeting notes, decisions, and changes were thoroughly documented and shared in a shared Google Drive folder. This practice helped in keeping the entire team on the same page and acted as a reference point for any discrepancies.

### 2. Feedback

Iterative Feedback Loops:
We implemented short development cycles to produce working software early and often, enabling us to gather frequent feedback from all stakeholders, including faculty and students who represented our end-users. This feedback was invaluable in refining the features and user experience of our application.

Peer Reviews:
Code reviews were a mandatory part of our development process. Before any code was merged into the main branch, it went through a peer review process. This not only ensured code quality but also facilitated knowledge sharing and collective code ownership, which are essential for collaborative development.

Prototype Testing:
We developed interactive UI wireframes early in the project, which were shared with potential users for feedback. This early and iterative validation helped us avoid major redesigns later in the project, saving time and resources.

Feedback Integration:
All feedback, whether from end-users, team members, or stakeholders, was logged and reviewed in our weekly meetings. The team discussed the feasibility and impact of incorporating this feedback into the project roadmap. Decisions made were then reflected in the scrum backlog and prioritized for upcoming sprints.

In summary, by embedding the values of Feedback and Communication into our project's fabric, we managed to stay aligned with our goals, adapt to changes efficiently, and deliver a solution that was well-received by users during our final project demo.

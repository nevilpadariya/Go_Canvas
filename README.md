## Backend Application
* Python - FastAPI
### How to run backend application
  1. Install dependencies
     > !pip install -r requirements.txt

  2. Run the application using following command
     > uvicorn main:app --reload

  3. Check Documentation
     > go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs after running the application

## Project Technologies Stack:

* Backend -> Python, FastAPI
* Database -> MySQL
* Frontend -> React
* Wireframes -> Figma
* Deployment -> Render (Backend) & Vercel (Frontend)

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment on Render

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
3. Click on "New+" and select "Blueprint"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure the Web Service:
   - Environment: Docker
   - Branch: main (or your preferred branch)
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - SECRET_KEY (generate a new secure key)
     - DATABASE_URL
     - CORS_ORIGINS (add your Vercel frontend URL)
6. Click "Create Blueprint" to deploy

Alternatively, you can manually deploy:
1. Click "New+" and select "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select "Docker" as the environment
4. Configure the settings and environment variables
5. Deploy

### Frontend Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your frontend code to GitHub (make sure it has the vercel.json file)
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure the project:
   - Framework Preset: Create React App
   - Root Directory: frontend (if you're deploying from the main repository)
   - Environment Variables:
     - REACT_APP_API_URL (your Render backend URL)
6. Click "Deploy"

Once deployed:
- Backend API will be available at https://your-app-name.onrender.com
- Frontend will be available at https://your-app-name.vercel.app

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Always use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- Generate a strong, unique SECRET_KEY for production

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for database access
- Restrict database user permissions to only what is necessary
- Set up proper network security for database access

### Deployment Security
- Configure SSL/TLS for all production traffic
- Use secure headers in your FastAPI application
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

### Deployment on Render
1. Create a new Web Service in Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select "Docker" as the environment
4. Set up the required environment variables in the Render dashboard
5. Deploy your application

Remember to set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
- SECRET_KEY (generate a new secure key for production)
- DATABASE_URL (use your production database connection string)
